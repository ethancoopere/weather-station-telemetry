## Introduction

The Weather Station Telemetry project aims to provide accurate weather data through a robust telemetry system. It leverages various technologies to gather, process, and transmit data efficiently. This project is suitable for anyone interested in embedded systems, IoT, or aerospace applications.

## Features

- **Real-time Data Acquisition**: Collects data on temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
- **Telemetry**: Transmits data wirelessly for remote monitoring.
- **Arduino Compatibility**: Built on the Arduino platform for ease of use and flexibility.
- **NASA Standards**: Adheres to NASA standards for data integrity and reliability.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple commands to retrieve data and configure settings.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Weather Station Telemetry system, follow the steps below. You can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/ethancoopere/weather-station-telemetry/releases).

### Prerequisites

- **Arduino IDE**: Download from [Arduino's official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
- **Arduino Board**: Compatible boards like Arduino Uno, Mega, or Nano.
- **Sensors**: Temperature, humidity, and wind sensors.
- **Wi-Fi Module**: For wireless communication (e.g., ESP8266).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use the command below to clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ethancoopere/weather-station-telemetry.git
   ```

2. **Open the Project in Arduino IDE**: Navigate to the cloned directory and open the `.ino` file in Arduino IDE.

3. **Install Required Libraries**: Make sure to install any libraries specified in the `README.md` or within the code comments.

4. **Upload the Code**: Connect your Arduino board and upload the code to your board using the IDE.

5. **Set Up Sensors**: Connect the sensors as per the wiring diagram provided in the repository.

6. **Run the System**: Power on your system and monitor the output via the Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE.

## Usage

Once the system is up and running, you can start using it to monitor weather conditions. The telemetry system will send data to a specified endpoint, which you can access through a web interface or a mobile app.

### Commands

The system supports various commands for configuration and data retrieval. Refer to the command list in the code comments for more details.

## Technologies Used

- **Arduino**: For embedded programming.
- **C++**: The primary programming language used.
- **IoT Protocols**: MQTT, HTTP for data transmission.
- **Sensors**: DHT22 for temperature and humidity, anemometer for wind speed.
- **Database**: Optional integration with a cloud database for data storage.

## Architecture

The architecture of the Weather Station Telemetry system consists of several components:

- **Sensor Module**: Collects weather data.
- **Microcontroller**: Processes the data and manages communication.
- **Communication Module**: Handles data transmission to the server.
- **Server**: Stores and processes incoming data for display and analysis.
